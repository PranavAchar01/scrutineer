"""STEWARDS' TIMING — the only thing that decides `pass`.

QUALI is public: the improver may read it through the telemetry rail. SEALED is private: it lives
behind `SealedEvaluator`, which never returns an item, a prompt or a candidate — only the
aggregate `official:gen-n` object (race time, opaque per-item booleans, cost). That object is the
one thing that crosses the boundary, and it is what the debrief, the seesaw and `manifest_check`
read. No agent in the loop ever holds a sealed item.
